## 📝 Description

The Pre-Delinquency Risk Prediction Engine is a sophisticated, proactive analytics platform designed to safeguard financial institutions from credit losses. By continuously monitoring and analyzing customer financial behavior, the engine identifies subtle early stress signals that often precede a default. This early-warning system empowers banks to transition from reactive recovery to proactive intervention, allowing them to engage with at-risk clients and implement mitigation strategies well before delinquency occurs. Through data-driven insights, the engine enhances portfolio stability and optimizes risk management processes.
